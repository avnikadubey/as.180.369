Within Daniel C. Dennett’s article “The Problem With Counterfeit People,” the author highlights the growing presence of artificial intelligence and other forms of counterfeit technologies as well as the lack of governance and regulation around the rising industry, issuing a warning on the destabilizing consequences of the industry’s unchecked growth. Within his article, Dennett makes three main claims: He points to the roots and history of AI development, exposes our contemporary inability to distinguish between AI and reality, and recommends corporate and government policies necessary for implementation to prevent dire ramifications. Although his warning is apt and well-attuned to public fear regarding the growth of AI, Dennett fails to address the most pressing issues regarding AI - that is, its sociopolitical and economic consequences. Sociopolitically, AI’s current use in institutional settings harms minority communities due to unregulated, prejudicial screening methods. Economically, the presence of counterfeit technologies has started to play a central role in the growing rate of unemployment witnessed in the United States, with the potential to robustly influence employment demographics in numerous industries. This summary serves to review the three facets of Dennett’s perspective on AI while providing additional insight into the jarring, contemporary influences of counterfeit people on both a sociopolitical and economic level.


Firstly, Dennett starts his analysis of counterfeit people by tracing its origins in Alan Turing’s 1950 proposal of “the imitation game.” The Turing test served as a benchmark to indicate real thinking by pairing an individual with a computer to determine whether machines could demonstrate human intelligence. Although its design was quite simple, it was manipulative in its origin: The game’s design encouraged the computer to manipulate the player into believing they were human. Over the course of 70 years, this test inspired a robust industry of well-funded, high-functioning technology designed to trick even those most skeptical about the field. Secondly, Dennett explains that the growth of the AI industry has resulted in the blurring of lines between people and computers. He recounts that differentiating between technology and reality has become increasingly muddled, with authentication becoming a growing aspect of everyday life. For example, one-step and two-step verification systems continue to become more prevalent as counterfeit people and technology revolutionize, signaling that protection measures are weaker and grow at a slower rate than advanced AI systems. He also laments that individuals have the potential to lose their agency to counterfeit people as they reproduce and grow more prevalent in high positions. This fear of the pervasive presence of AI drives Dennett to his third point. Dennett urges both corporate and governmental entities to adopt regulations around counterfeit people and the dissemination of AI technology. In addition to promoting a watermark system, Dennett encourages policymakers to develop consequences for corporations that do not adapt to regulation and continue to promote unethical usage of AI. Ultimately, Dennett’s narrative forebodes the coming realities of counterfeit people and encourages the adoption of policy to effectively capitalize on the benefits of this revolutionized technology while minimizing its potential for harm. Dennett’s review, however, largely ignores the large-scale and harmful changes the AI industry has already catalyzed in the United States.


From a national perspective, counterfeit people and technologies have already proven to have negative sociopolitical and economic impacts. Firstly, from a sociopolitical lens, AI’s use in institutional settings disproportionately targets and harms minority populations. The system that most AI platforms operate on links inputs to aligned concepts found across the Internet. Because of this setup, AI systems are exposed to unfiltered repertoires of information. The lack of filtration methods results in AI platforms adopting a variety of viewpoints, even those that tend to be racist and prejudicial. For example, a study on the consequences of AI technology by Alex Najibi of Harvard University finds that when employed for law enforcement surveillance, airport passenger screening, and employment and housing decisions, AI facial recognition software tends to disproportionately discriminate against minorities and people of color (Racial Discrimination in Face Recognition Technology, Najibi). From an economic perspective, AI continues to have a destabilizing effect, catalyzing the rapid loss of jobs. A report by Goldman Sachs in 2022 finds that AI has the potential to replace an equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, primarily due to the unmatched productivity levels achieved by some AI systems currently employed in corporate settings (“AI Could Replace Equivalent of 300 Million Jobs,” Goldman Sachs). The report highlights the ability of generative AI to create content almost indistinguishable from human work: a facet that has only improved over the past year. 


Ultimately, Dennett’s fear of the negative consequences associated with the unchecked growth of the AI industry accurately reflects the in-field observations of counterfeit technologies. It is imperative that policymakers and corporate officials adopt more stringent regulations to both address the ongoing injustices enacted through AI technology as well as prevent a future in which humans lose their agency and ability to systems of technology.
