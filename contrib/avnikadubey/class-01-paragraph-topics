Research Topic Paragraphs

*Topic 1: Profitability of small vs large firms (subject to data availability)*

The performance gap between large and small firms measures the difference in the median return on operating assets under management by firms. Although the performance gap steadied around 15% in the 1990s, as reported by the Harvard Business Review, in recent times its doubled to nearly 30-35%. When analyzing this growth on an individual level, it appears that smaller firms have tended to suffer from unprofitability; whereas, large firms have grown in their operations, scaling up business iniatives at a faster pace. An inspection of small firm performance over 2015-2017 found that the median return on assets and the median profit of small firms was negative, while larger firms saw a slow but steady increase in profit accumulation. Additionally, the percentages of small and large firms declaring losses highlights the nuances of profitability potential and its relationship to company size. The Harvard Business review continues that, while 10-15% of large companies reported annual losses in recent years, that numbr skyrockts to 60-65% of small companies. This statistic highlights that, in addition to the profitability gap, almost two-thirds of small businesses are unable to cover their expenses, despite the rapid economic growth witnessed over the past few years. 

As I researched the profitability gap and its main drivers, one of the most prominent correlators to profitability as associated with corporations was the dominant party in government and federal policy undertaken. Within my research, I hope to identify the relationship between government politics and corporate profitability, understanding the strong correlation between in corporate profitability during times of Republican and Democratic administrations. This research is insightful as it has numerous implications on the future of the profitability gap and the driving inequality witnessed between large-scale and small-scale companies today. Considering that small businesses employ a larger and larger share of Americans each day, identifying and addressing the root issue of the profitability gap is imperative in order to best understand employment and wage growth within the United States.  

*Topic 2: Change in corporate earnings*

In the years following the Global Finance Crisis of 2008 and 2009, U.S. corporations have maintained their profitability, finding newfound methods through which to augment their earnings, either through technological improvements or productivity enhancing mechanisms. Although there are many factors that can have induced greater corporate earnings, many economists believe that there is a strong link between the decreasing of real wages and the rising level of corporate profit. In fact, a study by the FED finds that the corporate profits increased share of GDP has been roughly offset by a decline in employee wages, falling from 56% of GDP from 1970 to 2000 to about 53% over the past decade. While the share of wages has declined, the share of capital has skyrocketted from 18% to slightly over 21%, insinuating a movement away from labor-centric strategies to capital-centric. This steady movement away from the prioritization of labor has resulted from a slew of economic trends that have manifested over the past two decades - that is, the continued progression of technology, the impact of globalization, and the widening "skills gap" which prioritizes steady wages for high-skilled, well-educated workers over low-skilled, uneducated workers. The relationship between the rising rate of corporate earnings and the decrease in real wages has catalyzed the worsening of economic inequality both within the United States and abroad as capital resources are drained from all countries to facilitate the profitability of corporations based in the United States. 

Through my research, I hope to find a systematic relationship between the rise of corporate earnings and the decrease in real wages for employees. However, I do understand that corporate earnings can be influenced by a number of factors, including the trade balance, exchange rate considerations, administration demographics, and many more. Within my research, I hope to focus on the relationship between the prices of capital and labor and their impact in driving up corporate earnings. Due to the rising levels inflation viewed over the past 30 years, it is imperative that this topic is studied as it will highlight the trade-off corporations are making to sustain their companies earnings and profit at the cost of providing their employees with wages that are competative with the global market for goods in an inflationary setting.
