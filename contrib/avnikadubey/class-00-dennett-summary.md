In Daniel C. Dennett's article "The Problem With Counterfeit People," the author delves into the profound implications of the growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies in the contemporary United States, while also spotlighting the glaring absence of adequate governance and regulation within the burgeoning industry. Throughout his article, Dennett articulates three primary claims: he traces the historical roots of AI development back to the mid-1900s, elucidates the contemporary challenge of distinguishing AI from reality, and advocates for the implementation of corporate and governmental policies to avert the dire ramifications of unchecked AI growth. While Dennett's concerns about the growth of AI are undeniably valid and prescient, his analysis overlooks the sociopolitical and economic consequences that have already begun to manifest within the United States. By analyzing the impacts of AI that have already become a staple of life, policymakers are better suited to address the unconsidered challenges that unchecked growth may catalyze.

In an analysis of his text, Dennett initiates his narrative by tracing the inception of counterfeit people to Alan Turing's 1950 proposal of the "imitation game." Known as the Turing test, this conceptual framework served as a benchmark to discern real thinking by pairing human subjects with computers to determine whether machines could convincingly demonstrate human-like intelligence. However, as Dennett astutely observes, the game's initial design was manipulative in nature, urging the computer to manipulate the human participant into believing that it possessed human-like intelligence. Over the course of 70 years, this foundational concept evolved into a well-funded industry with a singular goal: to create AI and technology capable of mimicking human intelligence to an unprecedented degree. It is within this historical context that Dennett's warning and exploration begins.

Dennett's second point is equally compelling, navigating the contemporary landscape where the boundaries between humanity and machines become increasingly blurred. The differentiation between technology and reality has become a multifaceted challenge, with authentication and verification measures struggling to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI. One-step and two-step verification systems, once considered strong safeguards against the risks associated with a free-access Internet, now face the daunting task of countering the growing sophistication of counterfeit people and technology. Dennett's apprehension here extends beyond the mere inconvenience of dealing with false positives or negatives in authentication processes. He raises a genuine concern: the potential loss of individual agency as counterfeit entities reproduce and proliferate, potentially attaining spots in high-ranking positions with the ability to influence. This fear of the pervasive presence of AI and its capacity to influence human decision-making processes drive Dennett to his third and final point. Although Dennett's point here is valid and reflective of the importance of institutions in guiding society, he fails to acknowledge how counterfeit people and AI technologies specifically can embed themselves within those high-status positions, rendering his argument slightly nebulous. More clarity on AI's ability to maneuver into such spaces would help bolster his argument.

Dennett's urgent call to action resonates strongly in his third claim. He implores both corporate entities and governmental institutions to embrace comprehensive regulations surrounding counterfeit people and the dissemination of AI technology. Among his recommendations is the adoption of a watermark system to distinguish genuine content from AI-generated or manipulated material. Furthermore, Dennett underscores the necessity of implementing consequences for corporations that continue to engage in unethical practices related to AI. In his view, such regulations are not merely a safeguard against potential risks but a fundamental requirement for ensuring that society effectively harnesses the benefits of this revolutionized technology while mitigating its potential for harm. Importantly, Dennett forgets to address the necessity for global regulations on AI development, as the issue extends beyond the peripheries of the United States. Much like what was witnessed in the competition of the Cold War, technological supremacy can lead to global hegemony. It is imperative that a global policy surrounding the appropriate and ethical uses of AI is developed in order to ensure that all countries are fair players when it comes to developing sophisticated technology, preventing potential national security concerns. 

As Dennett explores the dimensions of AI's impending impact, he fails to consider the consequences beyond the theoretical realm. In the United States, where AI and related technologies have already begun to enter into society, both sociopolitical and economic repercussions have become discernible realities. From a national perspective, counterfeit people and technologies have already proven to have negative sociopolitical and economic impacts. Firstly, through a sociopolitical lens, AI’s use in institutional settings disproportionately targets and harms minority populations. The system that most AI platforms operate on links inputs to aligned concepts found and absorbed from the Internet. Because of this setup, AI systems are exposed to unfiltered repertoires of information. The lack of filtration methods results in AI platforms adopting a variety of viewpoints, even those that tend to be racist and prejudicial. For example, a study on the consequences of AI technology by Alex Najibi of Harvard University finds that when employed for law enforcement surveillance, airport passenger screening, and employment and housing decisions, AI facial recognition software tends to disproportionately discriminate against minorities and people of color (Racial Discrimination in Face Recognition Technology, Najibi). From an economic perspective, AI continues to have a destabilizing effect, catalyzing the rapid loss of jobs. A report by Goldman Sachs in 2022 finds that AI has the potential to replace an equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, primarily due to the unmatched productivity levels achieved by some AI systems currently employed in corporate settings (“AI Could Replace Equivalent of 300 Million Jobs,” Goldman Sachs). The report highlights the ability of generative AI to create content almost indistinguishable from human work: a facet that has only improved over the past year and continues to perpetuate its growing threat.

Ultimately, Dennett’s fear of the negative consequences associated with the unchecked growth of the AI industry accurately reflects the in-field observations of counterfeit technologies. Dennett concludes that counterfeit people have the potential to control all aspects of life as their technological background grows more sophisticated, and he urges that action be taken at a governmental level to restrict this growth. Taking a page from Dennett's book, it is imperative that policymakers and corporate officials adopt more stringent regulations to both address the ongoing injustices enacted through AI technology as well as prevent a future in which humans lose their agency and ability to systems of technology. Without proper regulation and oversight, the benefits of AI may become overshadowed by the harms, catalyzing the demise of human agency.
