Since the 2010s, corporate responsibility has emerged as a facet of discussion among international corporations, predominantly contributing positively to financial growth in East Asian, European, and United States markets. In considering the numerous differences in corporate responsibility across geographic lines due to institution, cultural, and legislative differences; this study aims to investigate the correlation between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and corporate profitability of companies among emerging markets with sensitive industries. This study will be conducted using data from the MSCI Emerging Market database of over 2,000 companies, primarily focused on firms within the sensitive industries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, where ESG incorporatation has made robust strides over the past decade. The hypothesis of study is to identify whether Emerging Market firms that have integrated ESG within their corporate structure outperform their country's counterparts of firms that have not adopted ESG. Additionally, further analysis will quantify how much of a difference in corporate profitability has been viewed between the ESG-integrated companies and non-ESG integrated companies, underscoring the value of adopting corporate social responsibility beyond developed markets.
