Research Topic Paragraphs

*Topic 1: Profitability of small vs large firms (subject to data availability)*

The performance differential between large and small firms, gauged by the variance in median returns on operating assets under management, has been a subject of scrutiny. According to findings in the Harvard Business Review, this performance gap, which remained relatively stable at approximately 15% throughout the 1990s, has surged in recent years to nearly 30-35%. An individual-level analysis reveals that smaller firms have grappled with profitability challenges, while their larger counterparts have exhibited robust growth, accelerating their business initiatives.

An examination of small firm performance spanning from 2015 to 2017 unveils a troubling scenario. During this time period, it was found that the median return on assets and the median profit of small firms was negative, while larger firms saw a slow but steady increase in profit accumulation. Additionally, the percentages of small and large firms declaring losses highlights the nuances of profitability potential and its relationship to company size. The Harvard Business review continues that, while 10-15% of large companies reported annual losses in recent years, that numbr skyrockts to 60-65% of small companies. This statistic highlights that, in addition to the profitability gap, almost two-thirds of small businesses are unable to cover their expenses, despite the rapid economic growth witnessed over the past few years. 

Delving deeper into the research, a significant correlation exists between corporate profitability and the prevailing political landscape. As I researched the profitability gap and its main drivers, one of the most prominent correlators to profitability as associated with corporations was the dominant party in government and federal policy undertaken. Within my research, I hope to identify the relationship between government politics and corporate profitability, understanding the strong correlation between in corporate profitability during times of Republican and Democratic administrations. This research is insightful as it has numerous implications on the future of the profitability gap and the driving inequality witnessed between large-scale and small-scale companies today. Considering that small businesses employ a larger and larger share of Americans each day, identifying and addressing the root issue of the profitability gap is imperative in order to best understand employment and wage growth within the United States.  

*Topic 2: Change in corporate earnings*

In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, U.S. corporations have diligently sustained their profitability through innovative approaches, encompassing technological advancements and productivity-enhancing mechanisms. Among the myriad factors contributing to heightened corporate earnings, a prevalent view among economists is that augmentation of corporate profit is linked to the diminishing real wages observed in the economy. Notably, research conducted by the Federal Reserve (FED) reveals that the increasing share of corporate profits in GDP has been largely offset by a decline in employee wages, declining from 56% of GDP from 1970 to 2000 to approximately 53% over the past decade. This shift in the allocation of income away from labor towards capital is exemplified by the capital share, which has surged from 18% to slightly over 21%. This signifies a discernible departure from labor-centric strategies towards capital-centric ones.

This ongoing shift from labor-centric strategies to capital-centric strategies is attributable to a confluence of economic trends that have materialized over the past two decades. These trends encompass the persistent technological progress, the ramifications of globalization, and the widening 'skills gap,' which places a premium on employment for highly skilled, well-educated workers, while neglecting the prospects of low-skilled and uneducated workers. The differentiale between the burgeoning corporate earnings and the dwindling real wages has exacerbated economic inequality, both within the United States and on a global scale, as capital resources are channeled to sustain the profitability of U.S.-based corporations.

Through my research, I hope to find a systematic relationship between the rise of corporate earnings and the decrease in real wages for employees. However, with an understanding that corporate earnings can be influenced by a myriad of factors, including the trade balance, exchange rate considerations, administration demographics, and many more, my aim with this research will largely be focused on the intimate relationship between prices of resources and their effec on earnings. Due to the rising levels of inflation viewed over the past 30 years, it is imperative that this topic is studied as it will highlight the trade-off corporations are making to sustain their companies earnings and profit at the cost of providing their employees with wages that are competative within the global market for goods and services.
