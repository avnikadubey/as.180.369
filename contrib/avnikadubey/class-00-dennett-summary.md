In Daniel C. Dennett's article "The Problem With Counterfeit People," he delves into the profound implications of the growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies, while also spotlighting the glaring absence of adequate governance and regulation within this burgeoning industry. Within his article, Dennett articulates three primary claims: he traces the historical roots of AI development, elucidates the contemporary challenge of distinguishing AI from reality, and advocates for the implementation of corporate and governmental policies to avert the dire ramifications of unchecked AI growth. While Dennett's concerns about the growth of AI are undeniably valid and prescient, his analysis  overlooks the  sociopolitical and economic consequences that have already begun to manifest within the United States.

In reviewing a summary of his text, Dennett initiates his narrative by tracing the inception of counterfeit people to Alan Turing's 1950 proposal of the "imitation game." Known as the Turing test, this conceptual framework served as a benchmark to discern real thinking by pairing human subjects with computers to determine whether machines could convincingly demonstrate human-like intelligence. However, as Dennett astutely observes, the game's initial design was manipulative in nature, urging the computer to manipulate the human participant into believing that it possessed human-like intelligence. Over the course of 70 years, this foundational concept evolved into a well-funded industry with a singular goal: to create AI and technology capable of mimicking human intelligence to an unprecedented degree. It is within this historical context that Dennett's exploration begins.

Dennett's second point is equally compelling, as he navigates the contemporary landscape where the boundaries between humanity and machines become increasingly blurred. The differentiation between technology and reality has become a multifaceted challenge, with authentication and verification measures struggling to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI. One-step and two-step verification systems, once considered strong safeguards, now face the daunting task of countering the growing sophistication of counterfeit people and technology. Dennett's apprehension here extends beyond the mere inconvenience of dealing with false positives or negatives in authentication processes. He raises a genuine concern: the potential loss of individual agency as counterfeit entities reproduce and proliferate, potentially attaining spots in high-ranking positions with the ability to influence. This fear of the pervasive presence of AI and its capacity to influence human decision-making processes drives Dennett to his third and final point.

Dennett's urgent call to action resonates strongly in his third claim. He implores both corporate entities and governmental institutions to embrace comprehensive regulations surrounding counterfeit people and the dissemination of AI technology. Among his recommendations is the adoption of a watermark system to distinguish genuine content from AI-generated or manipulated material. Furthermore, Dennett underscores the necessity of implementing consequences for corporations that continue to engage in unethical practices related to AI. In his view, such regulations are not merely a safeguard against potential risks but a fundamental requirement for ensuring that society effectively harnesses the benefits of this revolutionized technology while mitigating its potential for harm. Yet, as Dennett explores the dimensions of AI's impending impact, he fails to consider the consequences  beyond the theoretical realm. In the United States, where AI and related technologies have already begun to enter into society, both sociopolitical and economic repercussions have become discernible realities.

From a national perspective, counterfeit people and technologies have already proven to have negative sociopolitical and economic impacts. Firstly, from a sociopolitical lens, AI’s use in institutional settings disproportionately targets and harms minority populations. The system that most AI platforms operate on links inputs to aligned concepts found across the Internet. Because of this setup, AI systems are exposed to unfiltered repertoires of information. The lack of filtration methods results in AI platforms adopting a variety of viewpoints, even those that tend to be racist and prejudicial. For example, a study on the consequences of AI technology by Alex Najibi of Harvard University finds that when employed for law enforcement surveillance, airport passenger screening, and employment and housing decisions, AI facial recognition software tends to disproportionately discriminate against minorities and people of color (Racial Discrimination in Face Recognition Technology, Najibi). From an economic perspective, AI continues to have a destabilizing effect, catalyzing the rapid loss of jobs. A report by Goldman Sachs in 2022 finds that AI has the potential to replace an equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, primarily due to the unmatched productivity levels achieved by some AI systems currently employed in corporate settings (“AI Could Replace Equivalent of 300 Million Jobs,” Goldman Sachs). The report highlights the ability of generative AI to create content almost indistinguishable from human work: a facet that has only improved over the past year.

Ultimately, Dennett’s fear of the negative consequences associated with the unchecked growth of the AI industry accurately reflects the in-field observations of counterfeit technologies. It is imperative that policymakers and corporate officials adopt more stringent regulations to both address the ongoing injustices enacted through AI technology as well as prevent a future in which humans lose their agency and ability to systems of technology.
